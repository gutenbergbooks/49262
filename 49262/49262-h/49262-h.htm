<h2><a name="A_CORNISH_HAVEN" id="A_CORNISH_HAVEN">A CORNISH HAVEN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Come</span> away with me to the sea! Let us go to
Cornwall, where sea and air are of the purest and
most exhilarating. Jumping into the train and
proceeding westward until we come to Launceston,
there we will leave the little quiet old-world town
behind. So anxious are we to get to the sea, that
we will not even stop to climb the hill and inspect
the old castle which frowns down on us; but we
will mount to the box-seat of the three-horse coach
which stands waiting at the station, and drive
away&mdash;still westward. Away, over the breezy
uplands, where the cattle chew the cud sleepily
beneath the August sun, between hedges set with
brilliant jewels, which we call flowers, past undulating
downs in whose hollows the purple shadows
lie dreaming.</p>

<p>We stop presently at a little roadside inn, to
give the horses a rest and a feed; and I climb down
from my elevated position and partake of a cup of
tea in the inn kitchen&mdash;a primitive flagged kitchen,
with a great high-backed wooden settle by the fire,
and pewter bowls and cups shining on the walls.
They pour out my bohea from a teapot which a
fancier of old china would pronounce to be priceless.
Genuine old 'Plymouth' it is, I see, and
ask if they would be willing to part with it. But
no; 'It was granny's;' and they would rather not
sell it; so I turn my covetous eyes away, and
clamber back to my seat beside the coachman.</p>

<p>Off we go again, along a fairly level road. The
country is but thinly inhabited, and there are
long intervals between the houses. By-and-by we
begin to descend a hill, and enter a little sleepy
town, where at first sight it seems to me that there
are an inn and one or two shops, but no inhabitants.
Only at first sight; for as we draw up
before the <i>Hotel</i> (such is the proud boast I see
over the doorway), and the driver descends and
walks away to deposit a parcel or two and to
gossip awhile with his acquaintances, we are
delivered over to the tender mercies of the whole
juvenile population, who surround the coach,
climb on to the wheels, and make audible comments
in very broad vernacular on our personal
appearance and on our apparel.</p>

<p>This time we move off slowly, for we have a
very steep hill to encounter, and the tired horses
plod somewhat wearily up it. As we reach the
top, and they stop panting to rest, I see far away
on the horizon a silver streak, and my heart gives
a throb of delight; for I have in its intensest form
all an islander's love for the ocean, and I know
what that silver streak is on which the sun shines
so gaily. On rolls the coach merrily; the horses
sniff the air, and seem to know that they are
nearing home. Yes; here are the breezes we have
come to look for. They peer familiarly under my
hat; they blow my veil aside, and rudely kiss
my cheeks; and their breath is fresh and salt,
and whispers of new strength to the tired mind
and body. On we hurry towards the setting sun,
who is now mounting the chariot in which he
drives away to the other side of the world. We
have lost sight of the faint line of silver again, and
our view is almost bounded by the dusky hedges.
Presently we turn a corner abruptly, and there,
apparently at our feet, lies the blue Atlantic,
smiling bright welcoming smiles at us in the last
rays of departing Sol. The active young breezes,
which seem so glad to see us again, revive us
with sweet aromatic odours, which they gather
from the weed-strewn rocks. They evidently
think we are wise people to have left those weak-minded
little zephyrs coquetting with the flowers
on the lawn at home, and to have followed them
to their sporting place beside the restless ever-changing
sea.</p>

<p>In another moment we stop, and all the tired
travellers dismount and stretch their cramped
limbs. I hear many around me inquiring for
hotels or lodgings; but we are expected, and here
is our landlady's husband come to meet us; so we
hand over our luggage to him, and wend our way
to Cliff Cottage. Here we find a smiling hostess,
who tells us how glad she is to see us; and after
we have removed some of the dust of our journey,
we sit down to a well-spread tea-table, on which a
noble Cornish pasty holds the post of honour. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">{450}</a></span>
draw the table into the bow-window, which faces
not directly seawards, but towards the bay, which
has been a haven of safety to so many. But it is
growing dark already, and we are weary with our
long drive; so, soon we seek our fragrant chamber,
in which the lavender scents struggle faintly to
overpower the pungent aroma of the sea; and it
is not long before we are lulled to sleep by the
monotonous thunder of the waves on the rocks
below.</p>

<p>In the morning we peep out at the colliers
which ride safely in the little sunny bay, at the
white houses which are dotted here and there over
the cliffs, and at the little village itself lying
snugly in the hollow. To right and left, sweeping
far away, stand the great eternal sea-walls of
sombre iron-stone crags, and the grassy downs
rolling away inland, unbroken except by a lonely
stone or a patch of golden gorse; and beneath us
lie ancient gray boulders and stretches of yellow
sand. Away on the hill opposite stands the little
church, in whose quiet graveyard rests many a
sailor who has found his death in the pitiless
sea. Eleven graves mark the resting-place of the
crew of one vessel, whose figure-head forms an
appropriate headstone to the sad group.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done after breakfast is to
bathe. It is not enough to be <i>by</i> the sea; we
must be <i>in</i> it, if we wish to rob it of all the
strength and vigour we can; so we start off
over the downs to where a sudden depression
in the cliff leads to the bathing beach. Here
we find old Harriet the bathing-woman, browner
than ever, who gives us a cordial welcome. The
bathing is primitive in the extreme. Harriet
possesses two tents, which she pitches daily on a
smooth spot of sand. For the use of one in which
to disrobe you pay a ridiculously small sum, which
also includes old Harriet's watchful 'surveillance'
while you are in the water. As the number of
tents is so limited and the bathers many, not a
few avail themselves of the shelter of a friendly
rock behind which to perform their toilet; but I
am squeamish, and wait my turn for the tent.
And oh! how reviving the plunge into the surf,
which comes rolling in frothing and seething like
champagne, and which knocks me over and plays
at ball with me as if I were a cork! The cool
waves curl and cling round me, and kiss my
arms and hands lovingly with their wet lips. I
let them break over my bowed head, and clasp
them tenderly to my breast; but they slip away
from me, and riot and tumble round me with
joyous laughter, sprinkling eternal freshness from
their bounteous hands. I sniff the keen salt air
with delight, and let the foam toss me to and fro
at its own sweet will, until Harriet, who watches
me anxiously (she thinks me a somewhat rash
young person, I know), orders me authoritatively to
come in, saying I have had enough of it&mdash;for the
first time. Very reluctantly I obey; but it would
require a braver person than I am to contradict
the withered old sea-nymph, and soon I emerge
from the tent with streaming locks, feeling like a
giant refreshed.</p>

<p>Thank goodness, here are no brass bands, no
esplanade; a circulating library of such modest
pretensions that it does not circulate, and shops
in which it is next to impossible to spend any
money! At the chemist's we buy our groceries
as well as our drugs, and he is the only wine-merchant
the dear primitive little place can boast.
But we get mutton which transcends Southdown;
capital poultry and vegetables; butter such as I
have never tasted before or since; rich cream,
which you must call Cornish (not 'Devonshire'),
to please the buxom farmer's wife who supplies it
to you; and plenty of good fruit. And what do
you want more, with such a sky above you, such a
glorious sea at your feet, such a wall of ironstone
crags behind you? Down on the beach we go,
and dawdle away the hot summer afternoon. We
stretch ourselves on the tawny sand, where great
barriers of rock jut out on each side of us, beneath
the shadow of a dreadful scarped cliff, to which
no scrap of weed or herbage seems able to cling.
We look up at it with a sense of awe. We think
of the many ships, nearing home after a weary
journey, which have been driven by the storm's
pitiless whip straight into its terrible arms, there
to meet a dread destruction. We think of the
many struggling drowning wretches on whom it
has gazed down with its stony eyes during all
the ages it has stood there. The great billows
in their winter's fury have beaten and lashed
it until it is scarred all over; but still it gazes
calmly down at them, as if defying their malicious
rage. And yet, cruel as it is, how picturesque the
colouring as it ranges from the intense purple
black of the tide-line, through warm green and
brown shadows, to the bright high lights far away
above our heads.</p>

<p>Dark rock-pools lie behind us, lined with queer
zoophytes and delicate sea-anemones; beside us are
the crimson lady's finger and the golden trefoil; the
dainty scents of the sea-weed and the fresh wet
sand are in the air, and before us is the smiling
sea. Yes; he smiles at us to-day, though here&mdash;with
a restless surf breaking eternally on the
beach&mdash;he is never calm and rippling, as we see
him in more southern climes.</p>

<p>Presently the sun sinks lower in the heavens;
a breeze awakes, and the day turns cooler; so we
go for a walk along the smooth firm sand, which
the ebbing sea has left bare; through a wilderness
of weird black cliffs, which, when the tide is high,
range far out into the sea in castles and turrets
and spires of jagged rock; an iron-bound coast
indeed, hopeless to the shipwrecked mariner, save
for our friendly little haven. Far away on the
warm horizon hangs Lundy Island, like a shapely
gray ghost; very faint by day, and at night telling
us only by its revolving light where it is. We
walk on to a gorge up which we can make our
way to the top of the cliff, and homeward
over the undulating downs and by the banks of
golden broom. We pass through a little village,
where the myrtles and fuchsias are all abloom
in the cottage-gardens, and where the great yews
brood silently over the old gray church. The
door stands open, and we go in. What a dear
old church, with its quaintly carved oaken pews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">{451}</a></span>
and tender-hued stained glass windows! Evidently
the restoration-fiend has not reached here yet. Let
us hope that he will stay away, along with the
esplanade and the brass bands.</p>

<p>Sometimes we spend our afternoon or evening
out at the end of the breakwater, which forms one
side of this little mariner's refuge. It connects a
rock which stands right out at sea, with the
shore, and occasionally in spring-tides is quite
under water. One evening, while standing on
the far end watching the glorious setting sun,
we forget to look behind us, and turning suddenly,
find the breakwater submerged. A man
could still cross it perhaps, but a not over-strong
woman might easily be carried over and drowned
by the on-coming surf. I am not brave enough
to face it; so we remain where we are, and enter
into conversation with a stalwart Cornishman,
who, with the instinct of a true gentleman,
volunteers&mdash;as the lady seems nervous, and as he
knows all about the tides, and exactly how high
the sea will rise to-night&mdash;to remain with us until
we are released by the ebbing waters. I rather
resent the imputation of timidity, but am very
glad he has imprisoned himself with us, as the
night turns darker and darker, and the waves
creep higher and higher, and wheel and foam and
thunder around, as if in impotent rage at their
inability to reach their prey.</p>

<p>Our Cornish hero reassures and consoles me,
telling me that they cannot possibly reach to
where we sit; and he whiles away the time with
stories of wrecks which he has seen, and also of
many hair-breadth escapes. He tells us how a
ship driving straight on to the cruel rocks, was
lifted by one giant wave over the breakwater and
'landed safely in the harbour beyond;' and I steal
a glance behind me, and see with thankfulness
that the waters are abating. In a little while
longer, with the help of our pleasant companion, I
am able to get over dry-shod, and it is with a
feeling of relief that I find myself once more on
mainland.</p>

<p>From this breakwater too, on a stormy day we
watch the life-boat go out for practice. How
gallantly she breasts the breakers, which seize her
and whirl her backwards, as if defying her to leave
the shore. The seamen tell us that in the great
storms which arise here during the winter she is
perfectly useless. No life-boat could live in the
seas which beat upon this heartless coast. Often
the coast-guardsmen have to creep on hands and
knees to their signal-station, as, standing erect,
they cannot face the wind. But the rocket apparatus
has saved many and many a life; and we
also one night see that fiery messenger of life and
hope speed away into the darkness over an imaginary
wreck; and a fictitious shipwrecked mariner
comes on shore in the frail-looking apparatus,
which slides along the rope, swaying to and fro
in the angry wind, looking like a frail thread,
suspended as it is in mid-air over the vexed and
tumbling waters below.</p>

<p>Sometimes we make excursions&mdash;to Tintagel
Castle, where King Arthur dwelt with his knights;
or away to wooded Clovelly, where Will Carey
lived, and Amyas Leigh suffered, and Rose
Salterne loved. Or to Stratton, in the neighbourhood
of which a great battle was fought, in
1643, between the Parliamentary and Royalist
troops, in which the former, under Waller, were
defeated. A cannon found on the field marks the
site of the combat; and in the High Street of
the town, a slab let into the wall of an old house
bears a legend telling how Sir Bevil Grenvil, the
victorious general, rested there after the fight.</p>

<p>But we like best to spend our days wandering
over the sands and the ancient mussel-clad
boulders, or straying across the breezy downs into
the rich smiling corn-country beyond, where in
the hedges the pale wild roses are transforming
themselves into brilliant scarlet hips, and the sun
is beginning to dye the blackberries a luscious
purple. Then as the day begins to tire, and prepares
to go in royal state to her rest, we love to
sit out on the rocks listening to the weary surges
which sing her a sweet monotonous requiem, and
watching the scarlet flames in the west steeping
the wet sands in a crimson stain as of blood. A
great belt of iron-gray clouds encircles the horizon.
Slowly the sun sinks behind it, gilding its edges
with a rich luminous glow, which faintly shadows
forth the glories the clouds veil from our eyes.
Lower and lower he droops his head, heavier and
still heavier with sleep, until one brilliant flaming
eye is all that we can see. Then the lid drops
over that too, and he is gone. Spell-bound, we sit
on, listening to the sea's mournful dirges, while
night swoops down over earth and ocean with
dusky wings. We watch the moon, like a vain
lady attiring herself magnificently in the east
before she issues forth on her evening pilgrimage.
She sends her handmaidens, the stars, before her,
and they light up her pathway with their brilliant
lamps. Then she comes forth robed in a filmy
veil of pearly lace, and mounts silently into the
sky, until she sits enthroned far above our heads.
She kisses the white crests of the waves, and
crowns them with silver, and peers with gentle
eyes at the solemn gigantic black cliffs, until they
seem to lay aside something of their stony harshness
in the light of those poetic orbs. The long
oar-weeds waving in the water seem to beckon to
her with inky fingers, and a few giddy young
stars obey the summons, for some of them have
fallen into the quiet rock-pools, and gaze up at
us out of their calm depths. The phosphorus
awakes and shoots out tongues of lambent flame,
as if seeking to outvie the splendour of the queen
of night. The waters glow as if they were on fire,
and the great dark billows rush in and cast sparkling
jewels at our feet.</p>

<p>How shall we resolve to leave all these delights?
Wild ocean is so kind to those who love him and
do him homage. He gives them back the strength
of which the struggle and turmoil of the world
have robbed them, and refreshes the weary spirit
with his gracious sights and sounds. Nature is
no step-mother, and for those who look at her
most tenderly and love her best, she paints her
fairest pictures and sings her sweetest songs.</p>

<p>But soon, too soon, the day comes when we must
bid good-bye to the kindly folks we have grown
to love so well; when we rest for the last time in
our sea-odoured chamber; when we take our last
walk over the downs, and loiter for the last
time beneath the shadow of the time-worn cliffs.
We leave the dear quiet little place, where we
have for a time hidden from the busy world, and
rested on our march; we leave it to the winds,
which grow ruder and more boisterous day by day,
and which soon will drive many a mariner to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">{452}</a></span>
refuge in its friendly haven. We shall find our
own little zephyrs at home quite grown up, and
strong enough to give us many a blow during the
winter.</p>

<p>But if there be any who, like me, would love to
linger on its quiet beach, to make acquaintance
with its giant wall of rocks, to drink its keen life-giving
breezes, to watch its gorgeous sunsets, or
dream beneath its silver stars&mdash;then, let them take
coach at Launceston, and following the declining
sun, drive westward away to&mdash;Budehaven.</p>

<p class='ph3'>CHAPTER XXXIII.&mdash;'A WOMAN'S ERRAND.'</p>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> making two or three attempts to obtain a
private interview with me, and finding that it was
not to be, Philip did not stay very long, explaining
that he had only come down for the papers, and
had business in town for the remainder of the day.
Somewhat more gravely and quietly than usual, he
shook hands with Mrs Tipper and Lilian; and
then, in a matter-of-course way, said: 'Come,
Mary.'</p>

<p>I knew that I must not refuse. Murmuring
an excuse for a moment, I ran up to my room
and fell upon my knees, asking for the strength
I so sorely needed for the coming trial; then
joined him again, and we went out together. As
we walked down the lane, I felt that he too was
nerving himself; and presently he asked, in a low
grave voice: 'What made you talk in the way you
did just now, Mary?'</p>

<p>I was in a difficult position. If I attempted to
justify myself, he would take alarm at once, and
bind me and himself still closer to our bond. I
could only treat it as a jest.</p>

<p>'We all talk nonsense sometimes, Philip.'</p>

<p>'I suppose so; but that is a kind of nonsense
you have not taught me to expect from you.'</p>

<p>'I am afraid you expect too much from me.'</p>

<p>'I certainly expect a great deal.'</p>

<p>Fortunately, I had something to say which
would keep off love-speeches; and without any
attempt to smooth the way, I said it.</p>

<p>'Philip, I want to ask you to give me ten
pounds. I have spent all my money.'</p>

<p>Oddly enough, he did not know that I was
entirely without money. I had thought it sufficient
to tell him only that my dear mother's
income died with her, not wishing to pain him
with the knowledge that I had been so nearly
destitute. I think he imagined that I had a small
income of my own, and as I avoided the subject,
did not like to appear curious about it. Even now,
I believe that he did not suspect me to be entirely
penniless, merely supposing that I had spent all
that I had in hand. The five-and-twenty pounds
had been expended to the last shilling in furbishing
up my modest wardrobe, and for small incidental
expenses in the way of my share towards
the cottages, &amp;c. I had shrunk from the idea of
making him acquainted with the state of my
finances; knowing how large-hearted he was, and
how much would be forced upon me if he once
guessed my need. Mrs Tipper was always protesting
against the value and number of the
offerings which found their way to the cottage,
whilst Lilian and I were afraid of expressing a
wish in his presence.</p>

<p>It was all very different now. It would cheer
and comfort him by-and-by to reflect that I was
able to ask a favour of him just at this crisis. Had
I not been so sorely pressed as I was, it would
still have been as well to ask him.</p>

<p>'Ten pounds!' he ejaculated, stopping short in
his walk to gaze at me in the greatest astonishment;
asking himself, I think, if <i>this</i> was the
explanation of the change which he had observed
in me. 'I am utterly ashamed of my stupidity in
allowing you to name such a thing; though I am
sure you will do me the justice to attribute it
solely to want of thought!'</p>

<p>'You see I do not mind asking you, Philip.'</p>

<p>'Mind indeed; of course you do not! I will
run back at once and write a cheque.'</p>

<p>'No; please do not&mdash;not if you have as much as
ten pounds with you. Just now, I want only that.'</p>

<p>'Ten pounds! Take what I have about me!'
hastily taking out his purse, and putting it into
my hand.</p>

<p>'But indeed I could not take all this!' I
returned, seeing that the purse contained several
notes as well as gold. 'I do not want any more
than ten pounds.'</p>

<p>'Nonsense; don't make a fuss over such a trifle.'</p>

<p>But I separated two five-pound notes from the
rest, and was very decided about his taking back
the purse.</p>

<p>'Then I shall of course send a cheque as soon
as I get back. By the way, Mary, I am making
arrangements for the settlement of three hundred
a year upon you; and of course all is yours, absolutely,
in the event of'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I broke down for a few moments, leaning against
the stile where we were standing.</p>

<p>'Nay, Mary'&mdash;&mdash; Then I think that he saw
something more in my face than even the allusion
to his death seemed to warrant. He went on with
grave anxiety: 'I fear you are not well. Is your
hand painful?'</p>

<p>Ah, my hand&mdash;how thankful I was for the suggestion!
I slipped it under my cloak, dragged
away the bandage, which again opened the wound.</p>

<p>'Bleeding afresh! You must really have it seen
to, Mary.'</p>

<p>'O no; it is really a very trifling affair.' In
my misery and despair, I almost laughed at the
idea of being able to feel any physical pain.</p>

<p>He assisted me to tighten the bandage again.
But I presently knew that it would not do to have
his hands touching me and his face close to mine
in this way; so, with a little brusque remark
about his want of skill (ah Philip, had you
known what it cost me!), I declared that my hand
required no more fussing over. I had the parting
to go through, and needed all my nerve. First, I
must make sure of his not coming down to the
cottage for two or three days.</p>

<p>'You said you expect to be very much engaged;
and therefore I suppose we shall not see you again
until the end of the week&mdash;Friday or Saturday,
perhaps?'</p>

<p>This was Tuesday, and I wanted to make sure of
two clear days.</p>

<p>'I will contrive to run down before that, if you
wish it, Mary.'</p>

<p>'No; I too have much to do. Do not come
before Friday.'</p>

<p>'Very well. You will tell me then which day
you have decided upon, since you will not say now.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">{453}</a></span></p>

<p>I had waived the decision as to which day the
wedding was to take place; and I did so again,
merely repeating 'Friday.'</p>

<p>'All right; take care of yourself; and be sure to
have the hand seen to.' He was stooping down to
give me the customary kiss before crossing the
stile; but I took his two hands in mine, and
looked up into his face, I think as calmly and
steadily as I had prayed for strength to do.</p>

<p>'God bless you, Philip.' Then I put my arms
about his neck, lifted up my face to his, and
kissed him. 'Good-bye, dear Philip.'</p>

<p>I saw an expression of surprise, a slight doubt
and hesitation in his eyes. He had not found me
so demonstrative as this before, and was for the
moment puzzled to account for it. But I contrived
to get up a smile, which I think satisfied him.
Then with a last wrench, I turned away, hearing
as though from another world his answering
'Good-bye' as he vaulted the stile.</p>

<p>After that, the rest would be easy. I allowed
myself one hour in the woods&mdash;not for the indulgence
of regret&mdash;I knew too well the danger of that&mdash;but
for recovery, and got back to the cottage in
time for our early dinner. Moreover, I forced
myself to eat, knowing that I should require all the
strength I could get; and delighted dear kind old
Mrs Tipper's heart by asking for a glass of wine.</p>

<p>It was a terrible ordeal, sitting there under their
tender watchful eyes; but I got through it tolerably
I think. Afterwards, I told them that I wanted
to catch the three o'clock up-train, adding a
purposely indefinite remark about having some
arrangements to make in town.</p>

<p>'Is Mr Dallas going to meet you, my dear?'
asked Mrs Tipper anxiously.</p>

<p>'No; I am going on a woman's errand,' I
replied, with a sad little half-smile at the thought
of what their surprise would be if they could
know how very literally I was speaking.</p>

<p>'<i>Must</i> you go to-day?&mdash;may not I go with you,
dear Mary?' pleaded Lilian. 'You are looking so
pale and unlike yourself; I do not like the idea of
your going alone.'</p>

<p>'I should fancy that there was something really
the matter with me, if I could not go alone so
short a distance as that, dearie,' I lightly replied.
'I think I will allow my age to protect me.'</p>

<p>She drew nearer to me, looking at me in the
nervous, half-afraid way she so frequently did of
late, as she laid her hand upon my arm.</p>

<p>'I wish you would not talk like that&mdash;dear Mary,
why do you?'</p>

<p>I was not strong enough to bear much in this
way; so replied with an attempt at a jest, which
made her shrink away again. I daresay my jests
were flavourless enough, and in strange contrast
to my looks.</p>

<p>Mrs Tipper's silent, anxious watchfulness was
even harder to bear than Lilian's tender love. It
was not my journey to town which puzzled them&mdash;I
saw that they imagined I was intent upon preparing
some little pleasant surprise for them at my
wedding&mdash;but the change they saw in me, which no
amount of diplomacy could hide.</p>

<p>How thankful I was, when I at length made my
escape to my own room; but I was not allowed to
go alone. I had to bear Lilian's loving attendance
whilst I was putting on my bonnet and cloak.
Indeed, she lingered by my side until I had got
half-way down the lane.</p>

<p>'You will not be very late, Mary?'</p>

<p>'No, dearie; I think not&mdash;I hope not.'</p>

<p>'We shall be longing to see you back.'</p>

<p>'And you must not be surprised if I return in a
very conceited frame of mind, after being made so
much of,' I lightly replied.</p>

<p>'Only come back <i>yourself</i>,' she murmured, giving
me a last kiss as she turned away.</p>

<p>Dear Lilian, did she in truth guess something of
what the lightness cost me? I knew that I did
not deceive her wholly. Although she might be
in some doubt as to the cause, I did not succeed
in hiding the effects from her.</p>

<p>I arrived at the London terminus about four
o'clock, and took a cab, directing the man to drive
to a West-end street facing St James's Park. My
errand was to one of the largest mansions there,
which at any other time I should have considered
it required some nerve to approach in a way so
humble. I could quite understand the cabman's
hesitating inquiry as to whether I wished to be
driven to the principal entrance. Probably I did
not appear to him quite up to the standard of the
housekeeper's room. Fortunately I was not able
to give a thought to my appearance. Had I been
visiting the Queen, I should have thought of her
only as a fellow-woman, in my deep absorption.</p>

<p>Three hours later I was taken back to the railway
station in a luxurious carriage, borne swiftly
along by spirited horses; a slight, refined, delicate-looking
woman, with earnest thoughtful eyes, and
attired almost as simply as myself, was sitting by
my side with my hand in hers, as we now and
again touched upon the subject which occupied
our thoughts.</p>

<p>I had found a friend in my time of need, and
such a one as I had not dared to hope for. But
this in due time. We parted with just a steady
look and grasp of the hand.</p>

<p>'To-morrow?'</p>

<p>'Yes; between six and seven.'</p>

<p>I returned to the cottage, certainly not looking
worse than when I had quitted it, and was received
with a welcome which made me almost lose
courage again. Fortunately it was very nearly our
usual time for retiring. Fortunately too I had
much to do, and it had to be done in the small-hours
of the night, so that I had no time to give to
the indulgence of my feelings when I was left alone
in my room. First turning out the contents of my
drawers and boxes, I separated from them a few
things which were absolutely needful for my purpose.
One dress and cloak and bonnet were all
that I should require, besides a small supply of
under-clothing. The latter I put into a small
trunk which Becky could easily carry, and then
replaced the other things in the drawers again,
arranging and ticketing them in orderly methodical
fashion as I wished them by-and-by to be
distributed. If 'Tom' should in course of time
prove more appreciative of Becky&mdash;which in consequence
of a hint I had received from Lydia, I
did not despair of so much as she did&mdash;I pleased
myself with the idea that the contents of certain
drawers would make a very respectable outfit for
her. The plain gray silk dress which I had purchased
for my own wedding would not be too fine
for hers. In a note placed on the top of the
things, I begged Mrs Tipper to give them to Becky
when the right time came. Afterwards I took out
the little collection of my dear mother's jewellery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">{454}</a></span>
It was really a much better one than I had
believed it to be. Indeed I had never before
examined the contents of the packet. When it
appeared probable that the jewels would have to
be sold, I had avoided looking at them; shrinking
painfully from the idea of calculating upon the
money value of my mother's only legacy to me;
and perhaps also in my time of need a little afraid
of being tempted by the knowledge of its worth.
One diamond ring, a large single stone, which even
I could tell was of some value, I put on the finger
of my left hand, which would never wear another
now. That was all I would keep. I then put
aside a pretty ruby brooch for my dear old friend
Mrs Tipper; and after some hesitation about
making a little offering to Philip, I satisfied
myself with selecting a valuable antique ring
which had belonged to my father, and writing a
line begging Lilian to give it to him with the love
of his sister Mary. The rest&mdash;I was quite proud
of the quantity now&mdash;I packed up and addressed
to the care of Mrs Tipper&mdash;my gift to my dear
Lilian on her wedding-day.</p>

<h2><a name="SUBMARINE_CABLES" id="SUBMARINE_CABLES">SUBMARINE CABLES.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>WORKING.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> working and maintenance of the existing
telegraph lines employ a vast number of people
taken all together; but it is surprising how few
hands are necessary for the working of any single
line or system. This is especially so in the case of
submarine cables, where, when the cable continues
sound, it is not necessary to support a staff for
surveillance and repairs. Half-a-dozen stations
several hundred miles apart, and half-a-dozen men
at each, are sufficient to carry the news from one
end of a continent to the other.</p>

<p>Without enumerating the telegraph systems that
now exist, it may suffice to say that the British
Isles are connected by submarine cables with
nearly every quarter of the globe, and that their
number is still increasing.</p>

<p>A telegraph station abroad, no matter in what
Company or country, presents nearly the same
characteristics wherever found. The more remote
the place, the more primitive may be the arrangements;
but the work is the same, the men are
about the same, and the instruments almost invariably
so. There is the superintendent; and under
him the clerk in charge, his right-hand man, who
oversees the clerks or operators at their work of
sending and receiving messages. Then, besides
these, and partly independent of them, there is the
electrician, a member of the scientific as distinguished
from the operating staff of the Company,
whose duties are to take periodical tests of the
cable and land-lines, to report on their condition,
and to keep the instruments in proper working
order. Under all these, there is generally the
messenger and battery-man, who may be called
the stoker of the electrical engine, and who,
besides, does the odd work of the establishment.</p>

<p>The station itself generally consists of the superintendent's
office or bureau; the instrument-room,
where the messages are sent and received; the
battery-room, generally under ground; and the
sleeping-quarters of the clerks. Occasionally the
electrician and clerk in charge have separate working-rooms;
and a smoking-room, with perhaps a
billiard-table and home newspapers, are added for
the convenience of all. Life passes quietly and
uneventfully at these stations, except when something
goes wrong with the instruments or the
cable, and then the electrician has his period of
anxiety and trouble; while the operators, on the
other hand, find their occupation at a temporary
standstill.</p>

<p>To understand the working of a submarine
cable and the actual process of sending a message,
it is necessary to figure in imagination the several
parts of the electric circuit, made up of the
battery, the instruments, the cable, and the
<i>earth</i> itself; and to remember that for a current
of electricity to flow through any part of the
circuit it is necessary that the <i>whole</i> circuit should
be complete. Starting then from the battery,
which is the source of the electric current,
we have the cable joined to it by means of a
key or sending instrument, which by the working
of a short up-and-down lever can connect or
disconnect the conductor of the cable to a particular
pole of the battery, the other pole of the
battery being the while connected to the earth.
The cable then takes us to the distant station.
Here the conductor is connected to the receiving
instrument, or instrument for making the signals
indicating the message, and through the receiving
instrument it is connected to the earth. The
electric circuit is thus rendered complete. The
current passes from one pole of the battery by
means of the key into the cable, through the
cable to the instrument at the other end, and
thence to the earth; and inasmuch as the other
pole of the battery is at the same time connected
to the earth at the first station, the conducting
circuit is complete, for the earth, no matter what
the intervening distance be, acts as an indispensable
part of the circuit.</p>

<p>We have thus the two stations connected by a
cable. At the station sending the message there
is the battery, from which the current proceeds;
the sending instrument, for letting the current
into the cable, or stopping it; and the 'earth-plate,'
or metal connection between one pole of
the battery and the earth. At the station receiving
the message there is the receiving instrument,
and again the earth-plate, connecting the
earth into circuit. These separate parts of the
circuit, as we have already said, must be 'connected
up,' as it is termed, so as to provide a
complete conducting channel for the current to
flow in from one pole of the battery to the
distant place and back again (or virtually so)
through the earth. Only at one place can the
circuit be interrupted and the current consequently
stopped&mdash;that is, at the key of the sending
instrument. Here then the sending clerk sits, and
by manipulating the lever of this key he 'makes
and breaks' the circuit at will, and thereby controls
the current. The regulated making and breaking
of this connection is the basis of telegraphing,
whether by submarine cable or by the ordinary
land lines. Accordingly as the clerk maintains
the circuit for a longer or a shorter time, so will
the current give longer or shorter indications on
the receiving instrument at the distant station:
or again, according as the opposite poles of the
battery are applied to the cable by the key, and
the direction of the current consequently reversed
in the cable, so will the indicated signals on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">{455}</a></span>
receiving instrument be of opposite kind. From
the elementary short and long signals, or right and
left signals, so obtained on the receiving instrument,
a code of letters and words may be built
up, and intelligible messages transmitted. The
Morse Code is that universally adopted, and for
the further information of our readers we here
append it as it is usually written:</p>

<p>For other accented letters, fraction signs, punctuation,
and official directions as to the disposal of
the message, there are other signs, but the above
are the essentials of the Morse Code. The long
and short signs represent the long and short
signals of the receiving instrument, produced by
the long and short contacts of the sending key
with the battery. It will be seen that the letter
A is rendered by a short signal followed by a
long one; the letter B by a long signal followed
by three separate short ones; and so on. Hence,
in order to telegraph the letter A to his colleague
at the distant end of the line, the clerk, by
depressing the lever of the sending instrument,
makes contact between the cable and the battery,
first for a short time, and then for a longer time.
The long and short signals are widely employed in
overland telegraphy; but in submarine telegraphy
a saving of time is effected by signals of <i>opposite
kind</i>. Thus, if a left deflection, or deflection of
the indicator to the left, signifies a 'dot' or short
signal, a deflection to the right will signify a
'dash' or long signal. In this case the sending
instrument or key has two levers, a right and left
one, corresponding to the distinct signal which
each produces. By depressing the left lever of
the key, a pole of the battery is applied to the
cable, which produces a left-hand signal on the
receiving instrument at the distant station; and
by depressing the right-hand lever, a right-hand
signal is produced. Proper rests or intervals are
permitted between the separate words, letters, and
full stops of a message.</p>

<p>The battery in common use for submarine
telegraphy is either the sawdust Daniell or
the Leclanché. The Daniell consists of a plate
of zinc and a plate of copper brought into
contact with each other by sawdust saturated
with a solution of sulphate of zinc; and crystals
of sulphate of copper (bluestone) are packed
round the copper plate, so as to dissolve there
in the solution of sulphate of zinc. The zinc
plate forms the <i>negative</i> pole of the battery,
and the copper plate the <i>positive</i> pole. When
these two poles are connected together by a
wire or other conducting circuit, such as that
made up of the cable and the earth, a current of
electricity&mdash;the voltaic current&mdash;flows from one
to the other, and always in one direction, namely,
from the copper or positive pole to the zinc or
<i>negative</i> pole. Hence it is that by applying the
one pole or other to the cable and the other to
earth through the earth-plate, the direction of the
current in the cable is reversed and opposite
signals produced.</p>

<p>The earth-plate is usually a copper plate several
feet square, sunk deep into the moist subsoil near
the station, so as to make a good conducting contact
with the mass of the earth.</p>

<p>The receiving instruments for working a submarine
cable are different from those used in
working land-lines. Inasmuch as the current
travels full strength, like a bullet, through a land-line,
and in the form of an undulation or wave
through a cable, so is it necessary to have
different kinds of receiving instruments for each.
In a land-line powerful currents can be used with
impunity, and these can be made, by means of
electro-magnetism, to move comparatively heavy
pieces of mechanism in giving signals. But in a
cable the currents are prudently kept as low as
possible, in case of damage to the insulator, and
the receiving instrument must therefore be delicate.
In land-lines the current passes in an instant,
leaving the line clear for the next signal, so that
the indications of the receiving instrument are
abrupt and decided. But in a cable the electric
current takes an appreciable time to flow from
end to end, so that the separate signals in part
coalesce, the beginning of one blending with the
end of that preceding it, so that the signals become
involved with each other. It is necessary, therefore,
that time be allowed for each wave to clear
itself of the cable before another wave is sent in,
otherwise we would have the cable as it were
<i>choked</i> with the message. A continuous current
of electricity may be said to be flowing through
it, and the ripples on the surface are the separate
signals of the message. It is to take cognisance of
these waves or ripples that the receiving instrument
for cable-work must be designed; and as the
quicker the message is sent into the cable the
smaller these ripples will be, the more delicate
should be the instrument.</p>

<p>There are only two instruments in use on
long cables, and both are the invention of Sir
William Thomson, the distinguished Glasgow
physicist and electrician. The mirror galvanometer
has been already described in this <i>Journal</i>
in a paper on the manufacture of submarine
cables; and the 'mirror' or 'speaker,' the commonest
of these receiving instruments, is but a
modified form of the mirror galvanometer. It
consists of a hollow coil of silk-covered wire, in
the heart of which a tiny mirror, with several
small magnets cemented to its back, is suspended
by a single thread of floss-silk fibre. A beam of
light from a lamp is thrown upon the mirror, and
reflected from it on to a white screen, across which
a vertical zero-line is drawn. When no current
is passing through the coil, the reflected beam of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">{456}</a></span>
light which makes an illuminated spot or gleam
on the screen, remains steady at the zero-line.
But when a current passes through the coil, the
magnets in its heart are moved and the mirror
with them, so that the beam of light is thrown off
at a different angle, and the spot of light is seen to
move from the zero-line along the screen to right
or to left of the zero-line according as the current
is made or reversed in the coil; so that as the
key is manipulated at the sending station, so are
right or left signals received by the clerk who sits
watching the movements of this spot of light, and
interpreting them to his fellow-clerk, who writes
them down. In the form of instrument here
described, and also in the other receiving instrument
for submarine work, the zero is not fixed but
movable. The vertical line on the screen is only
the nominal zero. The continuous current underlying
the ripples which form the message, deflects
the spot from the zero-line; but this slow deflection
can be disregarded by the clerk, for over and
above it there are smaller quicker movements
of the spot to right and left corresponding to
the ripples, and these are the proper signals of
the message. It requires long practice to make
a good 'mirror' clerk, one who can follow the
gleam with his eye through all its quick and
intricate motions, and distinguish between those
due to the shifting zero and those due to the
various signals sent. Even this compound-ripple
difficulty, however, is now got rid of by the use
of an apparatus called a 'condenser,' the effects of
which are that continuous currents are neutralised,
and the pulsations of the signals sent are <i>alone</i>
seen in the movements of the light upon the
scale.</p>

<p>The other instrument is the siphon recorder,
which permanently records in ink the signals
which the 'mirror' only shews transiently. The
principle of the siphon recorder is the converse of
that of the mirror. In the mirror there is a large
fixed coil and a light suspended magnet. In the
siphon recorder there is a large fixed magnet
and a light suspended coil. When the current
passes through this coil, the latter moves much in
the same way as the magnet moves in the 'mirror;'
that is, it rocks to right or left according as the
current flows. This rocking motion is communicated,
by a system of levers and fibres, to a very
fine glass capillary siphon, which dips into an ink-bottle
and draws off ink upon a strip of running
paper. The ink is highly electrified, so as to rush
through the siphon and out upon the paper,
marking a fine line upon it as it runs. When no
current passes in the coil, this zero-line is straight;
but when currents are passing, the line becomes
zigzag and wavy; and the right and left waves
across the paper constitute the message. Both of
these instruments are very beautiful and ingenious
applications of well-known electric, optical, and
mechanical principles. The great merit of the
recorder is that if a false signal is accidentally made
by the sending clerk, the whole word need not
always be lost by the receiving clerk, but may be
made out from the rest of the word written down.
Thus much repetition of messages is saved.
There is some advantage too in having a written
message for purposes of after reference.</p>

<p>A singularly ingenious system of telegraphy,
termed the <i>duplex</i>, has recently been extended to
long submarine cables, and is likely to become of
general, if not universal application. It is effected
by constructing an artificial line, in this case
representing an artificial cable, which shall have
the same influences on the current that the
actual cable has. The signalling current from the
battery is then split up at each station between
the actual cable and the artificial cable, so that
half flows into one and half into the other. And
there is placed a receiving instrument in such a
way between these two halves of the current that
they exactly counterbalance each other's effect
upon it; and so long as sending is going on from
a station, the receiving instrument at that station
is undisturbed. But the sending currents from
the other station have the power to disturb this
balance and cause signals to be made. Thus then,
while the sending at a station does not affect the
receiving instrument in connection with the cable
there, the currents sent from the distant station
cause it to mark the signals. Each station is
thus enabled to send a message and receive one at
the same time; and this is what is called duplex
or double telegraphy.</p>

<p>In ordinary telegraphy, one station is receiving
while the other is sending; but in duplex working,
both stations are sending together and receiving
together, so that there is little or no delay in
the traffic, and the carrying power of a busy
cable is practically doubled.</p>

<p>In case of accident to the cables each Company
maintains a repairing-ship ready to go to sea at
shortest notice. Some 'faults' are of a nature not
seriously to interfere with the working of a cable;
but it cannot be expected that they will remain
always in the same comparatively harmless state.
When a flaw occurs in the insulator it tends to
enlarge itself, and more of the current escapes to
the sea, until so much escapes that the current
which reaches the distant station is too feeble to
work the instruments there. All traffic therefore
ceases. The electrician's tests having localised
the fault so many miles from shore, the repairing-ship
proceeds to the spot. Here she lowers her
grapnel a mile or two on one side or other of
the supposed line of the cable, and when enough
rope has been let out, she steers very slowly
under steam, or drifts with the tide across the
cable's track. The grapnel is simply a great iron
hook, one approved form being like a compound
fish-hook, with five or six flukes starting from the
shank. A weight of chain drags behind it, to keep
it well down on the bottom. The rope, which
is generally of wire and yarn, passes under a
dynamometer, which indicates its tension, and
thence to the steam winch used for hauling in.
Often the grapnel catches in rocks, or mud, and
gives rise to false hope of the cable having been
found. The ship is brought to, and hauling in
commences; but soon the obstruction 'gives,' or
the grapnel itself breaks, and the true nature of
the 'catch' is found out. When the cable is
hooked, the greatest skill and care are needed,
especially when the ship's head lifts with the
waves, to bring up the bight carefully without
breaking the cable. When brought to the surface
the cable is cut, and each end is brought on
board in turn and tested. The fault, as we have
previously shewn with the paying-out ship, may
prove to be but a few miles distant. The sound
end is thereupon buoyed, and the ship proceeds
to pick up or haul in the faulty end until it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">{457}</a></span>
thought the fault must have been picked up. The
electrician then cuts off the piece which contains
the fault, and then he has only to join on a sound
piece of cable in its place, and lay it back to
the end that was buoyed, so filling up the gap.
But if it should <i>not</i> contain the fault, the tests are
again applied, until finally the fault is detected
and cut out. Repairing is arduous and trying work;
now giving rise to hopes, now crushing them, and
anon deferring them. A great responsibility rests
on those who undertake them, as the gain or loss
of a week or two may represent an enormous sum
of money to the Company.</p>

<p class='ph3'>IN TWO CHAPTERS.&mdash;CHAPTER II.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Had</span> Cissy only known it, there was very little
in Frank Halkett's words to cause her any
uneasiness. On his entering the drawing-room,
seeing his place by Cissy's side forestalled by the
major, whose person intercepted the beaming smile
of welcome she bestowed upon him, he had turned
away and thrown himself into the low chair that
stood by Mrs Leyton's cosy lounge.</p>

<p>'So you have taken refuge with me,' says that
lady with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>'Refuge!' repeats Halkett with an innocently
puzzled air. 'No; I have only taken a seat.'</p>

<p>'What's the matter with you, Frank?'</p>

<p>'Nothing. Why? Do I look dyspeptic?'</p>

<p>'You don't look pleasant, certainly, if that has
anything to do with it. Come; I am a witch, you
know,' says Mrs Leyton, 'and so can tell all your
secrets. And just to prove my power, I will tell
you something now&mdash;you are sulky this evening.'</p>

<p>'Meaning I am stupid, I suppose,' says Halkett;
'but it don't take much witchery to discover that.
I have an awful headache.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but I have not half done yet,' exclaims Mrs
Leyton. 'Shall I go on? I could tell something
very important, but that I am afraid of your heavy
displeasure. Will you promise not to be angry?'</p>

<p>'Angry with <i>you</i>! Was I ever that?' asks
Halkett tenderly. 'I give you full liberty to say
anything on earth you like to me.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean that?'</p>

<p>'Certainly I mean it.'</p>

<p>'Very good then,' says the widow with lazy
triumph; 'I will continue my sorceries; and first&mdash;you
are in love.'</p>

<p>'"In love!"' reiterates Halkett, forcing himself
heroically to meet her laughing eyes, and reddening
very much in the attempt. 'No, no; your
witchcraft has played you false this time.'</p>

<p>'It has not. I persist in my declaration. You
are in love&mdash;hopelessly, irretrievably, desperately
in love.'</p>

<p>'Well, perhaps I am,' says Frank, with tranquil
resignation. 'Is that strange? Could one be with
you, Frances, for so long a time, and not'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Nonsense!' interrupts Mrs Leyton. 'Do not
trouble yourself to complete that sentence. We
are much too old friends for <i>that</i>, I take it. And
now, Frank, be a good boy; emulate your name,
tell me all about it.'</p>

<p>'I really don't know that there is anything much
to tell,' says Halkett, smiling. 'But what there
is you shall hear. I admire a certain young lady
more than is good for me; I fancy, until to-day,
she returns my regard. I discover a couple of
hours ago that my vanity has misled me. I see
her happy in the arms&mdash;no, in the society of
another&mdash;I find myself nowhere, hence my dyspepsia,
distraction, and despair.&mdash;Don't look so
sympathetic, Frances; probably I shall get over it.'</p>

<p>Though he says this with a laughing face, Mrs
Leyton's dark eyes can see for themselves he is
tremendously hard hit.</p>

<p>'And what is her name?' she asks sweetly.</p>

<p>'O Frances! You laying claim to be a witch,
and must even ask <i>that</i> question? I decline to
answer it. Your fairy lore should enable you to
find out that much for yourself.'</p>

<p>'I love my love with a C because she is candid;
I hate her with a C because she is capricious,' says
Mrs Leyton archly. 'Am I "warm?" or will you
still cry "cold?" If you do the latter, I doubt
you will be wronging your conscience. Ah, Frank,
I think I am one too many for you!'</p>

<p>'You were always that. What one man is
equal to any woman? Well, as you have guessed
so far, I believe I may as well tell you the rest;'
and forthwith he commences to pour forth a tale,
the telling of which had caused Cissy such exquisite
anguish.</p>

<p>When he has finished, Mrs Leyton says: 'If
you will take my advice, you will seek the first
opportunity that offers, and ask for an explanation
of her coldness.'</p>

<p>'You really think that the best thing to do?'
says Halkett, brightening. 'I will act upon your
advice then, and try my chance. Now let us forget
it for the present. Is that a new ring upon your
finger? May I look at it? Does it mark a fresh
adorer?'</p>

<p>'No; an old one. Geoffrey Hyde gave it to me
last autumn.' She surrenders her hand to him
as she speaks; and he bending over it, examines
leisurely the cluster of brilliants that scintillate
and flash beneath the lamp-light.</p>

<p>'He has been faithful to you for a long time,'
says Halkett presently.</p>

<p>'Yes; he is very tormenting. I really believe
I shall have to marry him in the long-run, if only
to get him out of the way.' She reddens a little
as she says this, and laughs rather nervously.</p>

<p>'Are you serious?' asks Halkett with surprise.
'Then you are going to make him a happy man
after all?'</p>

<p>'That remains to be proved. Probably I shall
make him a wholesome warning to all obstinate
men. But I think when last I saw him I made
him some foolish promise about marrying him in
the spring.'</p>

<p>'I congratulate him with all my heart, and you
too,' says Halkett cordially. 'I think he is the
only man I know <i>quite</i> worthy of you.'</p>

<p>When the hour comes for bedroom candles to
be adjusted, Halkett seizes one, lights it, and
carries it solemnly to Miss Mordaunt. But quick
as he has been, Major Blake reaches her side
similarly armed, almost at the same moment.</p>

<p>'Which shall I take?' says Miss Cissy gaily.
'I suppose I can have my choice. I think <i>this</i>
pleases me most;' and she holds out her hand
towards Blake with a pretty smile. 'Thank you,'
she continues, slipping her slender fingers into his
brown palm; 'and good-night. Don't smoke too
much;' and with a little provoking backward nod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">{458}</a></span>
she trips away, without bestowing so much as
one poor glance upon Halkett. And so ends his
first attempt at an explanation, leaving him so
indignant that he almost vows he will not seek
another.</p>

<p>All the following day Miss Mordaunt studiously
avoids him, giving him no chance of obtaining the
tête-à-tête she sees is impending. But Halkett
calmly bides his time, knowing it cannot be far
distant. As daylight fades, he feels more than
ever determined to bring her to book before the
dawn of another morning; and in this instance
at least the Fates favour him, as there is to be a
large dancing-party at the Hall to-night. She
cannot well refuse to give him one dance out of
the many&mdash;such palpable avoidance would be
rather <i>too</i> marked; and once he has secured her as
his partner, she must be at his mercy until the
dance comes to an end.</p>

<p>This idea of course has also occurred to Miss
Mordaunt, and though dreading the interview, she
is still sufficiently indignant to cause her to make
up her mind to be as curt and outspoken on the
occasion as will be in strict keeping with her
dignity. In this frame of mind she goes up-stairs
to dress, and being an Irishwoman, it cannot be
altogether said but that she sustains a rather
pleasurable sensation&mdash;albeit one largely mingled
with something very much akin to nervousness&mdash;as
the battle-hour draws nigh.</p>

<p>'What shall I wear, Kennedy?' she asks her
maid, sinking languidly into a chair.</p>

<p>'Well, miss, you know you look well in anything,'
says Kennedy obligingly; 'there is nothing
but what becomes you; but if I might be allowed
to suggest, you look lovely entirely in white.'</p>

<p>'I won't wear white; I hate it,' says her mistress
pettishly. 'Débutantes, and brides, and corpses
wear white; I think&mdash;I shall wear&mdash;<i>black</i> to-night.'</p>

<p>'Black? O Miss Mordaunt!'</p>

<p>'Yes; certainly. Is gay clothing so necessary
to me, then?'</p>

<p>'Well, miss, there's no doubt but you look
real handsome in black; but the other ladies&mdash;they
will be so gay&mdash;and you'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'I shall be gayer than any of them, and the
greater contrast!' cries Cissy, springing to her feet.
'Come, Kennedy; despatch, despatch; I feel I
shall hold my own yet.'</p>

<p>And Kennedy throwing herself heart and mind
into her task, soon turns out the most charming
picture possible.</p>

<p>As Miss Mordaunt enters the drawing-room she
sees Halkett standing on the hearth-rug in earnest
conversation with the widow, who, if there is a fire
anywhere, is never any great distance from it. He
has been telling her of his repulse of the night
before, and is looking somewhat dejected.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' says Mrs Leyton kindly; 'get her
<i>alone</i>; then <i>you</i> will have the advantage. I think
she must have heard&mdash;or fancied&mdash;something that
wounds her.'</p>

<p>'I do not flatter myself so far; I merely think
she prefers Blake, and wishes to get rid of me,'
says Halkett gloomily.</p>

<p>'Nonsense! Let nothing induce you to believe
that. In the first place, she doesn't even <i>look</i> at
the man in the right way.'</p>

<p>Halkett laughs in spite of himself, and immediately
afterwards becomes if possible even
more despondent than before.</p>

<p>'How can she like that fellow Blake?' he says
ill-naturedly.</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't see <i>that</i>. For my part, I think him
absolutely handsome.'</p>

<p>'Of course, that goes without telling. All
women have a <i>tendresse</i> for those great coarse
broad-shouldered men. And what an accent he
has!'</p>

<p>'Do you really dislike it? To me, I confess it
is rather pleasant; mellow, with just a touch of
the brogue. Your Cissy, you must remember, has
it too, with perhaps rather more of the mellow and
less of the brogue; but then you are prejudiced
against this poor Blake.'</p>

<p>'Indeed I am not; you mistake me altogether:
I think him a downright good fellow. In fact I
have a fancy for all Irishmen; they are so full
of go&mdash;chic&mdash;good-humour, until crossed. And
Blake is like all his countrymen, a most enjoyable
companion,' says Halkett with suspicious
warmth.</p>

<p>'Evidently Miss Mordaunt is of your opinion,'
says the widow rather cruelly, pointing to where
Cissy is listening with a smiling face to one of the
major's good stories.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the guests are arriving; and the fine
old room that has been given up to the dancers is
rapidly filling with pretty girls and powdered
dowagers and men of all ages and degrees. Papas
too are numerous; but these instinctively crowd
round Uncle Charlie, and by degrees edge towards
a more dimly lighted room, where instinct tells
them, whist is holding silent sway.</p>

<p>'Will you give me the first dance?' says Halkett
to Mrs Leyton, who readily grants her consent.
Major Blake has of course secured Cissy; and
presently, as ill-luck will have it, they find themselves
in the same set, dancing opposite to each
other. As Halkett's hand meets Cissy's, he hardly
lets his fingers close round hers; and as she is also
in a revengeful mood, the ladies' chain almost falls
to the ground. Mrs Leyton, in spite of the good-nature
that lies somewhere in her composition,
nearly chokes with suppressed laughter as she
witnesses this little by-play. She twits Halkett
about it later on, but he is moody, and doesn't take
kindly to her witticisms.</p>

<p>At least half the programme has been gone
through before Captain Halkett asks Miss Mordaunt
for the pleasure of a dance.</p>

<p>'If I am disengaged,' she says coldly, not looking
at him, and searches her card with a languid bored
air that tantalises him almost beyond endurance.
He is longing to say: 'Never mind it; I wont
interfere with your enjoyment this time,' with his
sweetest smile, and rage at his heart; but he is
too sternly determined to have it out with her
to-night, to let his natural feelings win the day.</p>

<p>Cissy examining her card finds she is not engaged
for the next dance, very much to her disgust; and
is pondering whether she shall tell the lie direct
and declare she is, when Halkett, as though he
divines her thoughts, says abruptly: 'Not engaged
for the next? Then I suppose I may have it?'</p>

<p>'I suppose so,' returns Miss Cissy reluctantly;
and instantly turning from him, addresses her
partner, as though such a person as Halkett were
no longer in existence. Indeed, when after a
quarter of an hour, he finds her in the conservatory
and claims the fulfilment of her promise, it is with
the utmost bad grace she places the very tips of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">{459}</a></span>
her fingers upon his arm, and looks impatiently
towards the ball-room.</p>

<p>'I don't mean dancing just yet; I have something
particular to say to you first,' says Halkett
hastily, and almost commandingly, standing quite
still. 'It is hardly private here. Would you find
it too cold to come with me into the garden?'
glancing at the open door of the conservatory.</p>

<p>Cissy hesitates; then fearful of seeming reluctant,
says: 'No. If you will go to the library for my
shawl (you will find it on the sofa), I will go with
you.'</p>

<p>'You will stay here until I return?' says Halkett,
regarding her intently.</p>

<p>Cissy stares in turn. 'Of course I will,' she
answers rather haughtily; and he goes.</p>

<p>'Did he imagine I would run away when his
back was turned?' she soliloquises angrily. 'Does
he suppose I am <i>afraid</i>? One would think it was
<i>I</i> was in the wrong, not he. His conduct altogether
is downright mysterious. I cannot understand
him;' and for the first time it dawns upon
her mind that there may possibly be some flaw in
the interpretation she has put upon his conduct.</p>

<p>Returning with the shawl, Halkett places it
gently round her shoulders, and they pass into the
quiet night.</p>

<p>'What a beautiful moon!' exclaims Cissy presently,
hardly knowing what to say.</p>

<p>'Yes;' absently.</p>

<p>'And for this time of year, how wonderfully
mild it is&mdash;not in the least cold&mdash;as one might
expect.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;no&mdash;is it not?'</p>

<p>'I really don't know what <i>you</i> think about it,'
says Miss Mordaunt impatiently. 'I for my part
find it almost warm; but of course I cannot
answer for you. Probably all this time you are
feeling desperately cold.'</p>

<p>This little petulant outburst rouses Halkett.</p>

<p>'No!' he says with sudden energy and warmth;
'I am <i>not</i>. It is not in my nature to be cold in
any way. I feel most things keenly: more especially
slights from those I love. All ill-concealed
disdain, unkind speeches, fickleness, touch me
closely.'</p>

<p>'I can sympathise with you,' says Cissy calmly.
'I think nothing can be so bad as inconstancy&mdash;except
perhaps deceit.'</p>

<p>This retort being as unexpected as it is evidently
<i>meant</i>, puzzles Halkett to such a degree
that he becomes absolutely silent. Miss Mordaunt,
with her white shawl drawn closely round
her slight black-robed figure, walks quietly beside
him with the air of an offended queen, her head
held rather higher than usual, a pretty look of
scorn upon her lips.</p>

<p>After a while Halkett pulls up abruptly and
faces her in the narrow pathway. 'What is the
reason of your changed behaviour towards me to-day
and yesterday?' he says shortly. 'I think I
have a right to ask that.'</p>

<p>'<i>Have</i> I changed?'</p>

<p>'<i>Have</i> you? Must you ask the question? The
whole world can see it. You treat me with the
most studied coldness.'</p>

<p>'I thought I was treating you with as much
courtesy as I give to all my uncle's guests.'</p>

<p>'I don't care for courtesy,' says Halkett passionately;
'your hatred would be better than your indifference.
Yesterday morning I believed we were
friends&mdash;nay, <i>more</i> than that; yesterday evening
you ignored me altogether. It is either heartless
coquetry on your part, or else you have a reason
for your conduct. Let me hear it.'</p>

<p>'You are forgetting yourself,' says Miss Mordaunt
coldly. 'You are the first person who has
ever accused me of coquetry; you shall not do
it again. I was foolish to come here with you,
but&mdash;I trusted you. I wish to return to the
house.'</p>

<p>'Nay, hear me!' cries Halkett remorsefully,
following as she makes a movement to leave him,
and catching her hand to detain her. 'Your avoidance
has so perplexed and maddened me, that I
said more than I meant or intended. Forgive me,
and at least let me know how I have offended.
Cissy, answer me!'</p>

<p>For a moment Miss Mordaunt hesitates, then
endeavouring to speak lightly: 'I did not intend
to perplex you,' she says; 'one cannot speak to
every one at the same time. I am sorry if I
appeared rude or neglectful; but you did not <i>look</i>
very miserable, and surely Mrs Leyton was an
excellent substitute for me.' She smiles as she
says this, but pales a little too beneath the brilliant
moon that is betraying her.</p>

<p>'Mrs Leyton is my very oldest and dearest
friend,' replies Halkett; 'but no one on earth could
console me for&mdash;your loss. Why will you not
confess the truth, Cissy, and'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yet you once loved her, if report speaks truly,'
interrupts Miss Mordaunt, still speaking carelessly,
though her heart-throbs can almost be counted.
'In India, we hear, there was a time when you
would gladly have called her your wife. Is it not
so?'</p>

<p>Halkett drops her hand.</p>

<p>'Has that miserable bit of gossip taken root even
here?' he says with a faint sneer. 'Has Blake
been making his cause good by such rubbishing
tales? Frances Leyton and I grew up together. I
would as soon think of making love to my nearest
of kin as to her. The idea of any romantic
attachment existing between us is more than
absurd! Besides, she is to be married to Geoffrey
Hyde early in the coming spring.'</p>

<p>Miss Mordaunt severs a little twig from one
of the shrubs, and takes it to pieces slowly.</p>

<p>'Then <i>she</i> did not give you your favourite mare?'
she says quietly, detesting herself as she asks the
question, yet feeling compelled to solve all her
doubts at once.</p>

<p>'No; she did not.' A pause. 'Shall I tell you
who gave her to me? It was my only sister,
Lady Harley. She loved the Baby dearly, and
on her death-bed, told me to take good care of
the creature, for her sake.'</p>

<p>The twig falls from Cissy's fingers. Surely,
surely it cannot be true! Oh, how he must hate
and despise her for all she has said and done! It
is too late now to make reparation. She feels she
would rather die a thousand deaths than give in,
and confess to all the wretched suspicions and
jealousies she has been carefully harbouring in her
heart during these two past days.</p>

<p>'However, all this is beside the question,' goes
on Halkett; 'you have not yet told me what I so
much want to know. Has Blake anything to do
with your coldness to me? Tell me, Cissy, are
you engaged to him?'</p>

<p>Cissy has not expected this, and growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">{460}</a></span>
suddenly crimson, lets her head droop somewhat
suspiciously. Halkett's eyes are on her face.</p>

<p>'No; of course not&mdash;I am not indeed.' There is
a faint stammer in her speech as she says this, and
Halkett's fears become certainties.</p>

<p>'But you <i>care</i> for him!' he exclaims vehemently.
'The very mention of his name has brought a flush
into your cheeks. You hesitate, and turn your
head aside. This then accounts for your sudden
change of behaviour towards me! Having gained
your point, you found your first victim in the way,
and hardly knowing how to get rid of so troublesome
an appendage, had recourse to&mdash;&mdash; Had you
told me point-blank my attentions were unwelcome,
it would have been more womanly, more
just'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Pray, do not say another word,' says Miss Mordaunt
with dignity, though tears are in her voice
and eyes; 'this is the second time to-night you
have spoken words difficult to forget. Do not
trouble yourself to return with me. I prefer going
in alone.'</p>

<p class='tb_space'>When Cissy and Halkett appear at breakfast the
following morning, they take care to seat themselves
as far as possible from each other, and
presently it becomes palpable to every one that
they are considerably out of sorts. Uncle Charlie
suggests that Miss Cissy has over-danced herself, or
given the wrong man his <i>congé</i>; a remark that has
sufficient truth in it to bring the hot blood into
her cheeks. While Captain Halkett, having run
through his letters, declares he must return to town
by the afternoon train; at which Mrs Leyton
looks uneasy, and casts a covert glance at Cissy
Mordaunt.</p>

<p>That young lady stands fire pretty well, but
with all her hardihood cannot keep her under lip
from trembling ever so little. This sign of weakness
be assured does not escape the widow's tutored
eye; and she instantly challenges Major Blake to
a game of billiards after breakfast.</p>

<p>'My dear Frank, you can't go to-day,' says
Uncle Charlie decidedly. 'To-morrow they have
promised us the best run we have had yet. I will
not hear of your leaving. Write and tell her you
have sprained your ankle, and send her your
undying love. She will forgive you when she sees
you.'</p>

<p>'I wish I <i>could</i> stay,' says Halkett, laughing;
'but unfortunately my recall is from my solicitor,
not from my lady-love.'</p>

<p>'I don't believe a word of it!' says Uncle
Charlie. 'A sudden recall <i>always</i> means a woman.
Why, when <i>I</i> was a young man, I thought nothing
of'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'My dear!' says Aunt Isabel, with a gentle
uplifting of the right hand.</p>

<p>'Quite so, my good Belle,' returns Uncle Charlie,
patting the soft white fingers. 'But seriously,
Frank, she will do very well without you.'</p>

<p>'I have no doubt of <i>that</i>,' says Halkett, and
raising his eyes meets Miss Mordaunt's full.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Cissy, feeling mournful and
guilty, steals round to the stables to take a last
look at the Baby, as she is afraid to look at the
Baby's master. Just as she is patting her and
rubbing down the soft velvet muzzle, the door
opens, and Halkett enters.</p>

<p>'I am glad to see she is so much better,' says
Miss Mordaunt promptly but nervously, pointing
to the injured limb. 'If you go to-day, you will
not take her with you, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'No; I suppose not.'</p>

<p>'<i>Must</i> you go?'</p>

<p>Halkett glances at her reproachfully. 'Yes; of
course I must. There is no other course left open
to me. After what you told me last night, it
would be simple madness to remain.'</p>

<p>'What did I tell you? I don't think I told you
anything.'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;what you led me to infer.'</p>

<p>'You should not infer things. <i>I</i> never meant
you to do so.' As Miss Mordaunt says this in a
very low tone, she turns her head aside and recedes
a step or two. A dark flush rises to Halkett's
brow, colouring all his face, even through the
bronze an Indian sun has laid upon it. A sudden
gleam of something akin to hope shines in his eyes
for an instant, but is as speedily suppressed.</p>

<p>'Do you know what you are doing?' he says in
a tone sufficiently unsteady to betray the agitation
he is feeling. 'Do you know what your manner,
your words seem to me to mean? Do not, I
implore you, raise within me again the hope I
have surrendered, unless&mdash;&mdash; O Cissy, <i>you</i> will
never know how cruel a thing it is to love without
return!'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;are you sure&mdash;<i>your</i> love&mdash;has gained no
return?' demands Miss Cissy in faltering accents,
and immediately afterwards feels she has but one
desire on earth, and that is for the ground to open
and swallow her.</p>

<p>'Cissy, Cissy!' cries Halkett, '<i>tell</i> me you do
not care for that fellow Blake!'</p>

<p>'Not a bit, not a bit!' says Cissy; and in another
moment finds herself in Halkett's arms, her tears
running riot over the breast of his coat. 'Oh, say
that you forgive me!' she sobs. 'It was most hateful
of me&mdash;about that bedroom candlestick the
other night, and everything. But I misunderstood
it all. I thought you loved Mrs Leyton. <i>Say</i>
that you forgive me!'</p>

<p>'I will not hear a word about forgiveness now,'
says Halkett, who has been assiduously employed
in kissing her hair, brow, and any other part of her
face that is visible. 'It is taking a mean advantage
of me; I am so happy this moment, I would forgive
my bitterest enemy without hesitation. By-and-by
we will discuss the question, and I shall
grant you pardon on my own terms.'</p>

<p>Some time before luncheon there comes a knock,
low but decided, at Uncle Charlie's library door.</p>

<p>'Come in!' calls out the owner of the apartment;
and the door opening admits Frank Halkett and
Miss Mordaunt&mdash;the latter keeping well behind,
and only compelled by the strong clasp of her
companion's hand to advance at all.</p>

<p>'I have come, sir,' says Halkett mildly, 'to tell
you I have, after all, decided on delaying my
departure until next week, as I at first intended&mdash;if
you do not object.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, indeed; I am glad of that,' says Uncle
Charlie, just a wee bit puzzled. 'I need not say
how welcome you are.&mdash;But what about the
business letter, eh, and your hot haste to reach
town? What has changed your plans, eh?'</p>

<p>'Miss Mordaunt,' says Halkett, with a mischievous
glance at Cissy, who is hopelessly
confused and horribly shamefaced, in the background.
'Miss Mordaunt has induced me to
alter my mind.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">{461}</a></span></p>

<p>'Eh! what, what?' says Uncle Charlie, rising
from his chair as the truth dawns upon him, and
instantly sinking back into it again. 'You don't
<i>mean</i> it! And all this time I could have <i>sworn</i> it
was that fellow Blake!'</p>

<p class='tb_space'>And so were made happy a pair who, through a
mutual misunderstanding, might have never come
together again in this world; who, but for an
accidental timely explanation, might have remained
through life victims to Cross-purposes.

<h2><a name="POLAR_COLONISATION" id="POLAR_COLONISATION">POLAR COLONISATION.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> the end of February the Naval Committee
of the House of Representatives at Washington
reported a Bill authorising the American
government to fit out an Arctic Expedition, which
would establish a colony on Lady Franklin's Bay,
and thence despatch exploring parties to the Pole.
To influence congressional action in this matter,
two or three pamphlets have been put forth in
America, and circulated among the members of
both houses. In one of these, Captain Henry W.
Howgate, U.S.A., advocates the doctrine, that to
reach the Pole with the greatest certainty, and
with the least expenditure of time, money, and
human life, it is essential that the exploring party
be on the ground at the very time when the ice
gives way and opens the gateway to the long-sought
prize. This, he affirms, can only be done by
colonising a few hardy, resolute, and experienced
men at some point near the borders of the Polar
Sea.</p>

<p>The same idea, in a somewhat different form, is
advocated by Mr R. W. D. Bryan, of the United
States' Naval Observatory at Washington, who, at
Captain Howgate's request, has expounded in a brief
pamphlet his views in regard to the best methods
of conducting Arctic exploration. Mr Bryan says
that he has given the subject much thought for
many years, and has carefully examined the rich
treasures of Arctic literature. This study, and his
own experience and personal observation during
the <i>Polaris</i> expedition, have suggested to him a
plan which seems comprehensive and practicable.
He is opposed to all spasmodic efforts to reach the
Pole, because the chances of success are not commensurate
with the necessary outlay. Let a vessel,
he says, be always ready at some advanced post to
push forward whenever an opportunity offers, for it
is well known to Arctic explorers that Polar ice
moves, shifts its position, and breaks up, sometimes
slowly, and at other times with great rapidity, and
that its position and condition change from year to
year; hence in the same place success in one season
may follow the defeat of a previous one. If,
therefore, a vessel be at hand when the movement
carries the ice out of her path, she can advance; and
if, unfortunately, she should have no such opportunity,
her officers and crew, by their observations
and their boat and sledge journeys, would be able
to employ their time profitably; the chances, however,
would probably be in favour of their finding
some season sufficiently open to admit of their
forcing the vessel towards the Pole. In connection
with the ship which is thus to watch year by year
for a friendly ice movement, Mr Bryan would have
a station established on the land within easy communicating
distance, and yet not so far north as to
prevent its being visited at least once in every two
or three years by a ship from the parent country.
The plan, no doubt, is one which would conduce to
eventual success; but we should fancy that even
the hardiest enthusiasts would shrink from an
undertaking which would involve their spending
annually from four to five months in total darkness,
even though 'the station should afford warm
comfortable quarters for a corps of scientific observers
and an active band of explorers.'</p>

<p>We cannot follow Mr Bryan through all the
details of his original plan, but it will be interesting
to glance briefly at a bolder and more comprehensive
one which he develops towards the conclusion
of his <i>brochure</i>. He says, and with reason,
that a greater certainty of speedy success and the
collection of scientific data beyond all measure
more valuable, would follow the enlargement of
the scheme he has propounded. 'Instead of establishing
one station, and having but one ship watching
tirelessly the mysterious movements of the ice,
let there be many stations and many ships placed
at intervals along the whole threshold of the
unknown region.' To this, of course, the obvious
objection arises that the plan would involve the
expenditure of a large amount of money; but Mr
Bryan is equal to the occasion, and perhaps taking
a hint from the king of the Belgians' proposition
with regard to African exploration, he suggests
that the enterprise should be an international one,
for in that case the burden upon any one nation
would be comparatively light. Mr Bryan has gone
further, for he has partitioned the work among
the nations. Great Britain is to grapple with the
difficulties of the Behring Strait route, and in
addition, to take a turn at 'the eastern coast of
Wrangell's Land or the western coast, or both.'
This, we imagine, would keep Sir George Nares
occupied for some time. For the United States is
claimed the right to consider the Smith's Sound
route as peculiarly its own; and the Germans are
to undertake 'the eastern coast of Greenland, the
route advocated so long and so well by their
illustrious geographer Dr Petermann.' The Dutch
are to take Spitzbergen for the base of their operations;
the Austrians are to follow up Lieutenant
Payer's discoveries in Franz Josef Land; and the
Russians are to establish stations upon Novaya
Zemlya and some of the extreme northern points
of their empire. Italy, Norway, and Sweden,
France, Spain, and Portugal have minor parts
assigned to them; but hardy Denmark, oddly
enough, is overlooked.</p>

<p>Mr Bryan thinks that the money laid out on
these enterprises would be 'well invested, and
would give an ample and speedy return in every
department of human industry.'</p>

<p>Since the foregoing was written, intelligence has
been received that arrangements are actually in
progress for carrying out Captain Howgate's bold
plan of prosecuting Polar discovery. The expedition,
we hear, will be under the command of
Captain Tyson, of <i>Polaris</i> fame, and it was intended
that it should leave at once for the Arctic regions
to select a position for the planting of a colony in
1878. The funds required for this advance voyage
(about ten thousand dollars) will be raised by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">{462}</a></span>
subscription in New York; and it is expected that
Congress will in autumn appropriate fifty thousand
dollars to cover the expenses of despatching the
colony.</p>

<h2><a name="A_FEW_WORDS_ABOUT_POULTRY" id="A_FEW_WORDS_ABOUT_POULTRY">A FEW WORDS ABOUT POULTRY.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no species of live-stock less understood
or less cared for than poultry. Almost every
farmer and nearly every cottager in the country
keeps hens, as well as a great number of people
about the suburbs of all large towns; and strange
as it may seem, if you ask them as to the profitableness
of their stock, you will almost invariably
be met with the answer that 'hens don't pay.'
Many people of course never take the trouble to
find out whether they pay or not, but go on rehearsing
the story of others who do take that
trouble, and who find it an unprofitable job. With
a large number of poultry-keepers this is really
the case; and there must therefore be a certain
fascination about fowls that induces such people to
keep them. The secret probably is that fresh eggs
being such an adjunct to the breakfast-table and
to the making of savoury omelets and puddings,
hens are kept to lay eggs, no matter how few, or
at what cost. Some people, however, do make
them pay, and pay well too; but it is only by
properly directed intelligence being brought to
bear on the subject, as well as by the exercise of
a good deal of care and attention, that this object
is attained. Many an amateur keeper of poultry
is able during the spring months to sell as many
eggs as he can part with at prices ranging from
six shillings to a guinea per dozen&mdash;such eggs
being the produce of prize poultry, and such
prices being given in order to rear chickens from
them. It is therefore principally amateurs, fanciers,
and people who take delight in and bestow care
and attention on their birds, that are able to reap
satisfactory results from the rearing and keeping
of poultry. If care and attention were not brought
to bear on the rearing of horses and cattle, these
would not pay either; but hens are, by farmers
especially, usually considered too insignificant to
bestow much trouble on; therefore they are often
allowed to run about starved and ill cared for at
one time, and glutted with food at another; while
their roosting-houses from want of cleaning become
so filthy that it is a wonder the birds so frequently
escape the diseases which filth engenders, and to
which the feathered tribe are so liable.</p>

<p>It is certainly not creditable to this country that
the importation of poultry and eggs is so enormous,
and probably few persons are aware of its extent.
In 1875, the latest year for which the Board
of Trade returns have been completed, no less
than seven hundred and forty-one million of eggs
were brought into this country; and the returns
of the immediately preceding years shew that
this importation has been making gigantic strides.
Most of these eggs come to us from France; and
when we consider that the French themselves are
large consumers of both eggs and poultry, it may
well be imagined to what an enormous extent our
friends across the Channel develop this branch of
trade or commerce. The advantage which our
continental neighbours derive from it is obvious
when we consider that not only eggs but fowls are
largely sent over to us; and that about three
millions of pounds sterling are now annually paid
by Great Britain for these two staple articles of
consumption. Farmers and poultry-keepers should
lay this well to heart, and endeavour by some
means so to increase the production of poultry
and eggs, as not only to secure the retention of a
large portion of this money in our own country,
but to fill their own pockets with a portion of it.</p>

<p>In our observation and experience the point
on which most ignorance prevails with regard to
poultry is food. No attention or intelligence
appears to be directed to the kind, quantity, or
time of feeding that is most suitable; and nowhere
is this ignorance more noticeable than at
farm-steadings. At such places, hens are generally
allowed to surfeit themselves with grain at
one season, while they are starved at another. Now
they do not lay well while they are either in the
one condition or the other; for a starved bird has
not the wherewithal to produce eggs, while an overfed
one gets lazy and accumulates internal fat, to
the extinction of egg-production altogether. Hens
never lay so well as when they are kept in a
state of activity, running after meat that is thrown
to them, or searching and scratching for it among
earth or rubbish. After moulting-time, or when
hens have been as it were resting from laying
eggs, one of the first things that to a keen
observer heralds a speedy return to that state,
is the restless activity with which they scrape
and scratch the ground. When their courts
or haunts bear evidence of this by the holes
which they make, laying is not far off. A happy
medium in feeding produces the best results
with poultry; and a golden rule is never to give
fowls more at a time than they will greedily pick
up. Indeed they should always be made to leave
off before their appetite is satiated. Their meals
should be given regularly, and should be thrown
on the ground to them, not left in wooden troughs,
which readily sour and taint the meat. But
whether given on the ground or otherwise, not a
particle should be allowed to lie over, for nothing
injures hens more than stale food.</p>

<p>The number of meals in a day may vary
according to circumstances, but for adult fowls no
more than three should ever be allowed. Where
hens have full liberty to roam about a farm-yard
or in fields, only two scanty meals should be given
both in summer and in winter&mdash;one in the morning
as early as possible, and the other about an
hour before they go to roost in the evening. Birds
which are confined to courts or runs should have a
more substantial meal&mdash;not later than nine o'clock
in the morning in winter, and an hour or two
earlier in summer, with a pick of something at
mid-day, besides their evening feed. Grain of some
kind should always be given them at night; wheat,
rough barley, or oats, are all good, but ought to
be used singly, not mixed; and it is well occasionally
to change the variety. Indian corn seems
to be more relished than any other grain, but
should be sparingly given, and never longer than a
very few days at a time, just for a change, as it
has a very fattening tendency. The morning meal
may consist of table-refuse of any sort mixed to a
proper consistency with sharps, middlings, bran,
or barley-meal. The mixture should neither be
too sloppy nor too hard, but such as if thrown on
the ground in a lump will break into bits, not
crumble down into a state of powder. Potatoes are
bad to use in large quantities, for like Indian corn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">{463}</a></span>
they are too fattening; boiled turnips, however,
may be used with advantage for mixing. In winter
it is best to give the morning diet warm, with an
occasional sprinkling of pepper during very cold
or wet weather. A very little salt may likewise
be added. The mid-day pick may either consist
of the morning's remains or a little grain; but
on no account should soft food be given after it
has stood for any length of time. It can be mixed
up at night, but what is then prepared should all
be used up on the following day. Grass or green
food of some kind is requisite to keep poultry in
good condition; and if the birds have not free
access to it, a little cut up and mixed with their
food, or a cabbage or lettuce hung up with a string
just within reach of the birds, so that they may
get at it with a little trouble, is a very valuable
accessory to the dietary. It is absolutely necessary
that green food be given regularly, if fowls
are expected to thrive; but the amount of it
need not be great; only if it is left off for a
time and then resorted to, or given in too large
quantities, it is likely to cause diarrh&#339;a.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to define the exact quantity
of food that ought to be given to hens, and it
is well to remember that at some seasons they
will eat much more than at others; but as a
general rule for those in confinement, a ball
about the size of a duck's egg in the morning,
half of that at mid-day, and an average-sized
handful of grain at night, is about the proper
quantity for each bird; and less than that of
course for those that have fields or farm-yards
to roam in. The tendency with most poultry-keepers
is to feed too well, and it is generally very
difficult to get them convinced of this, for hens will
go on eating long after they have had enough; but
the consequences are always bad, such as accumulation
of internal fat and the laying of soft or
shell-less eggs. This latter disease&mdash;for so it may
be called&mdash;is a very common effect of over-feeding
young hens, and is sometimes not observed till
it has existed for some time, as such eggs are
often eaten by the birds as soon as laid, and if
they are not caught in the act, those who keep
them may be none the wiser. The quickest and
most effectual way to cure the effects of over-feeding
is to administer a good dose of Epsom
salts in their soft food in the morning, and to
starve them till the following day. Indeed such
treatment to overfed fowls that have gone off
laying will often bring them into that condition
again at once. Poultry should always have access to
plenty of cool fresh water; and if the dish containing
it cannot be kept in a cool or shady place, the
water should be frequently renewed, especially in
warm sunny weather, for nothing is worse for hens
than sun-warmed water. It is also important that
a handful or two of small stones or gravel be occasionally
thrown into their runs, if the ground itself
is not gravelly, for hens swallow such stones to
assist the gizzard in triturating their food. It is
considered that lime or old mortar is necessary for
the production of egg-shell, but we cannot speak
authoritatively on this point, for we have kept hens
for years, and never yet saw them swallow a piece
of mortar, although they have access to it; but we
are bound to admit that oyster-shells, broken up
small, are at certain times swallowed with great
avidity, if fowls can obtain them.</p>

<p>Next to the importance of good systematic feeding,
if not even before it, ought to come cleanliness.
Some people never think of cleaning their
hen-houses and hen-runs; but it ought to be carefully
and regularly done; and the inside walls and
roosting-bars should be whitewashed at least twice
every year. In connection with this, it may be
mentioned that nothing is worse for a hen-house
than a wooden floor, as it soon gets saturated with
their droppings, and becomes rotten, when it is
impossible to clean it. A stone or cement floor, or
even an earthen one, is greatly superior to one
made of wood; and if such a floor be kept thickly
strewn with fine coal-ashes, sand, or dry earth,
this helps to deodorise the dung, and is easily
cleaned&mdash;besides the whole makes a very valuable
manure, which can be used in the garden. The floor
or ground of the court or run should be earth, the
surface of which can be lifted off occasionally with
a spade, and then dug up to freshen it. At such
times, the birds will get a feed of worms, which
will do them much good.</p>

<p>Fowls clean themselves by means of dust; and
if they have not access to it, they readily become
infested with a species of small lice. Finely
riddled coal-ash or dry earth laid in a sheltered
corner of their run will answer the purpose. It
should be renewed occasionally, and a little flowers
of sulphur or carbolic powder sprinkled on it.
It is very amusing to see the birds lying in their
baths and shaking the dust all over and through
their feathers. They seem to take great delight
in this occupation.</p>

<p>The variety to be kept depends on circumstances,
that which suits one locality being unsuitable in
another. Many people keep what are called barn-door
fowls, that is, a cross of all sorts of breeds, but
experience shews that such fowls are not profitable
either for the table or for laying. Occasionally
one hears that there is nothing like them for laying;
but those who speak thus have seldom much
experience of pure breeds; and because they now
and again find cross-bred birds laying remarkably
well, they are too apt to sound their praise. A
first cross between two pure breeds, such as the
'Dorking' and 'Spanish,' or 'Game' and 'Spanish,'
sometimes produces very fine profitable fowls; but
if these are again allowed to mate with other
crosses, the progeny always degenerates. The
Dorking is perhaps the most common and well-known
variety in this country, and holds a good
reputation for size and quality as a table bird,
also for its laying powers. It does not thrive,
however, in all localities, requiring a dry soil and
extensive range to roam on, and is essentially a
farmer's bird. Dorkings make good sitters and
mothers. The variety is bred to perfection, principally
in the counties of Sussex and Surrey. The
general favourites of 'fanciers,' owing to their
symmetry of form and beautiful plumage, are the
several varieties of Game; but they are somewhat
troublesome to keep, owing to their fighting proclivities.
Spanish hens are good layers of large
eggs, but the breed is a delicate one, difficult to
rear, and difficult to keep in health. Cold and
damp affect them much; but they sometimes do
well in confined runs, if these are dry and sheltered
and their houses warm. 'Brahmas' and 'Cochins,'
two Asiatic breeds, created quite a sensation on
their first being brought to this country about a
quarter of a century ago, and large prices were
then paid for them. As chickens they take a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">{464}</a></span>
time to grow, but ultimately attain great size.
They are both good layers, especially in winter,
when eggs are dear, but are inveterate sitters; and
the time lost by this propensity often neutralises
the profit which might be made from their egg-producing
qualities. 'Hamburgs' lay numerous eggs
of a rather small description. The French varieties
have been gaining ground in this country for some
years back, the 'Houdans' being splendid table
fowls, with good white flesh and small bones.
They grow very fast as chickens, but do not generally
begin to lay till well matured. 'Crève-c&#339;urs'
also grow quickly to a good size, but have not
much reputation as layers. The latest breed&mdash;which,
however, has not been known in this
country more than a few years&mdash;is the 'Leghorn,'
for the introduction of which we are indebted to
the Americans, who imported the first birds of the
kind from Leghorn about twenty years ago, and
have since then been improving the variety. It
would appear to excel most others for early development
and splendid laying powers, and is fast
taking a prominent place with poultry-keepers.
Prize birds of all distinct varieties are very valuable,
sometimes fetching as much as twenty-five
pounds for a single bird to shew and breed from.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake with some people to
keep too many birds, and we have noticed again
and again where a keen amateur has very reluctantly
been persuaded to kill off or dispose of a portion of
his stock, that instead of his egg-basket suffering
owing to the fewer birds kept, it has actually
become fuller than before. Only a certain quantity
can be kept on a given space, and if more than
this is attempted, failure must be the result. The
proper number can be arrived at only by experience,
but no cottager with limited accommodation
should attempt to keep more than about half-a-dozen.
The worst layers should be killed after
their first season's laying, just before they commence
to moult or cast their feathers&mdash;say about
July or August; for if allowed once to begin this
process of renewal, they are useless for the table
until the whole of the new feathers grow again;
and this sometimes occupies months, during the
whole of which time laying is generally suspended.
The best, however, should be kept over their
second season's laying, and then killed before
moulting; and none but the very best should
ever be allowed to see a third season, for age
is a very unprofitable and increasingly unprofitable
possession. From one hundred to two hundred
and fifty eggs may be expected from a
good bird in the course of a year; and those
which lay less than a hundred are not worth
keeping. It may be mentioned that the addition
of a cock to the run makes no difference in the
number of eggs which the hens will lay; it is
unnecessary, therefore, to keep a cock unless
chickens be desired.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
